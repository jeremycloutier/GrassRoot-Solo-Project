    <ul>
        <li>GrassRoot is founded on the idea of helping people get involved in their community; for this reason, registration with GrassRoot is fast, simple, and free.</li>
        <li>Once you submit your information in the form, you will be fully registered as a Member of the GrassRoot Network.  Members gain access to a home page from which they may search for events as well as submit events of their own.</li>
        <li>Because we value our users' privacy, GrassRoot keeps user data strictly confidential.</li>
